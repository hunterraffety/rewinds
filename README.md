Rewinds is a Remix starter kit with Tailwind CSS v3 family of libraries.

This is an example demo to combine the best Tailwind-related ecosystem such as Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Radix UI, Vechai UI, and more.

Visit live: [rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com)

Features:

- Remix as the React framework
- Tailwind CSS using Vechai UI as primary components
- Multiple themes switcher and persist theme with a session cookie
- Only focus on the frontend styling and project structure, without particular in testing and database
  - Only a bit of backend integration through Remix loader
  - For the full stack integration, check out the official Remix Stacks instead: https://remix.run/stacks
- More features listed in [the about page](https://rewinds.mhaidarhanif.com/about)

Caveats:

- Depending on your computer processing power, the Tailwind compilation might take around 3 seconds. Although Tailwind CSS v3 already has Just-in-Time engine.

- `axios`

### Deployment

- Vercel

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

### Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Copy the `.env.example` into `.env`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env
```

Setup the environment variables here and Vercel if want to deploy there.
If you don't need some of these, you can remove them in the `.env`, `app/utils/env.server.ts`, and all `getEnvServer()` function calls.

- `SESSION_SECRET` for persisting the themes on browser sessions
- `REST_ENDPOINT` for `fetch` or `axios`
- `GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` for `graphql-request` or `urql`
- `GRAPHCMS_ENDPOINT` for GraphCMS headless GraphQL CMS platform
- `CONVERTKIT_API_KEY` for ConvertKit newsletter platform account API key
- `CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID` for ConvertKit actual subscription form ID
- `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` for Google Analytics 4
- `POSTHOG_API_HOST` for PostHog analytics platform host
- `POSTHOG_API_KEY` for PostHog analytics API key
- `PIRSCH_ID_CODE` for Pirsch Analytics ID code

Afterwards, run the Remix development server with the `dev` script.

```sh
npm run dev
```

It will compile both the Tailwind styles and Remix app.
Finally, open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

Note if you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.

### Using Doppler

If you want to use [Doppler](https://doppler.com) to manage the env variables, use the `start` script. Therefore this won't need the `.env` file to be edited manually.

```sh
npm run start
# doppler run -- npm run dev
```

## Build

Make sure that it can build just fine:

```sh
npm run build
```

## Deployment

After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Notes

### Vechai UI

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to remove custom colors to reduce the stylesheet build size.
`cssBase` is still required to get the default Tailwind CSS colors into Vechai UI themes.

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
-       info: colors.blue,
-       success: colors.green,
-       warning: colors.yellow,
-       error: colors.red,
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    // ...
   require('@vechaiui/core')({
     cssBase: true,
-    colors: ['info', 'success', 'warning', 'error'],
   }),
  ],
};
```
