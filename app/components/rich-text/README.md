# Component: Rich Text

- Use `MarkdocRichText` if want to use Markdown.
  - This is better to render the fenced code blocks.
- Use `GraphCMSRichText` if want to use `raw` format from GraphCMS RichText.
  - This is helpful to render the indent-based code blocks that is not really supported smoothly with Markdoc.
